#### Lesson 1: Cloud Computing

##### 4. What is Cloud Computing

**Cloud Computing**
Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the Internet that allows you to manage:
Storage services likes databases
Servers, compute power, networking
Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
Security services for data and applications

**Characteristics of Cloud Computing**
Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

##### 5. Types of Cloud Computing

**Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**
The provider supplies virtual server instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers. For example `Rackspace`.

**Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**
A platform of development tools hosted on a provider's infrastructure. For example `Godday`.

**Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**
A software application that runs over the Internet and is managed by the service provider. For example: `Gmail`.

#### 6. Cloud Deployment Models

**Public Cloud**
A public cloud makes resources available over the Internet to the general public.

**Private Cloud**
A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people. "On-premises" BEST describes a private cloud.

**Hybrid Cloud**
A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud.
The hybrid model is a growing trend in the industry for those organizations that have been slow to adopt the cloud due to being in a heavily regulated industry. The hybrid model gives organizations the flexibility to slowly migrate to the cloud.

#### 7. Common Benefits

There are several benefits to the cloud.

- Stop guessing about capacity.
- Avoid huge capital investments up front.
- Pay for only what you use.
- Scale globally in minutes.
- Deliver faster.
